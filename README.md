# wine-pairing

A Claude Code skill that recommends wine pairings from your personal wine cellar. Tell Claude what dish you're cooking, and it will suggest wines from your collection based on classic pairing principles and drinking windows.

The skill has been incorporated directly under the [winebuddy](https://github.com/jasondchambers/winebuddy) repository.
